# Firebase Silent Data Access Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error where data access fails silently due to a mismatch between the expected data structure in your security rules and the actual data structure in your Firebase database. The error doesn't throw a clear exception but results in undefined values.

## Problem
The issue occurs when your Firebase security rules specify a strict data structure, and the data in your database doesn't perfectly match.  This leads to undefined values without explicit error messages.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully checking your data structure in the Firebase console to make sure it matches your security rules.  You might need to adjust either the data or the rules to resolve the mismatch. Handling potential missing fields with conditional checks in your code is crucial for robustness. See `firebaseBugSolution.js` for an example.
