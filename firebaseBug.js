The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon Firebase error related to security rules and data structure.  The error occurs when attempting to retrieve data that doesn't match the structure defined in your security rules, even if the data exists.

```javascript
// Incorrect data structure in Firebase
db.ref('users/uid').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const userData = snapshot.val();
  console.log(userData.profile.name); // Error if 'profile' is missing
});
```

This error won't necessarily throw a clear exception. Instead, `userData.profile.name` will be undefined, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes further down the line.  Debugging this requires careful examination of your data structure in the Firebase console and your security rules.

The security rules might look like this, causing this issue if the data doesn't exactly match:

```
users:
  '$uid': {
    '.read': 'auth.uid === $uid',
    '.write': 'auth.uid === $uid',
    profile: {
      name: true
    }
  }
```

If a user's data is missing the `profile` node, the read will fail silently.
